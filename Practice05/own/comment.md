<h2>Practice05 Review</h2>


Completeness: 100%
Code quality: The work is complete, but there are some errors.
Correctness: 80%
Pros:
<ul>
    <li>The work of each function differs well and clear.</li>
    <li>Use a string to show the answer rather than a number can prevent many problems.</li>
</ul>
Cons:
<ul>
    <li>If one click some buttons before enter a number, it'll crash. To avoid it, you can set some pointless conditions and let them "return" directly.</li>
    <li>When changing operator, the number will still change.</li>
    <li>when click "+/-" or "%" during calculation, sometimes it will crash.</li>
    <li>Use "round" to deal with decimal number.</li>
</ul>
