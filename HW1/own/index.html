    <h1>This is a Heading (h1)</h1>
    <h2>This is a Heading too! (h2)</h2>
    <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>
    <h4>This just goes on...</h4>
    <h5>and on..</h5>
    <h6>till h6!</h6>

    <p class="p1">
        This is a paragraph (p). Line breaks here: 
        <br>
        and continues...

        There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
        instance you can make words <b>blid</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>...
        <mark>the</mark> <del>list</del> <ins>goes</ins> <sub>on</sub> <sup>and</sup> on.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
        time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
        we seek.
    </blockquote>

    <div class="animate">
        A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
        and take up the full width available.
    </div>
    <br>
    <span class="animate">
        And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.
    </span>
    <br>
    <p class="p2" id = "end">
        Now head over to the version with css and see how powerful css is!
