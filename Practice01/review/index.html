                Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
                time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
                we seek.

            <p>A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
                and take up the full width available.</p>
            </div>
            <span>
                <p>And a span tag is inline, meaning span that it only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>
