        <h3>This is also a Heading! (h3)</h3>

            There are a lot of styles you can add to text without using css! For
            instance you can make words <b>bold</b>, <strong>important</strong>, <i>italicc</i>, <em>emphasized</em>, <small>small</small>, <sub>Subscript</sub>, <sup>Superscript</sup>, <mark>Marked</mark>, <del>Deleted</del>, <ins>Inserted</ins>...
            the list goes on and on.
        </p>
            You can also add quotes! For instance formal american president once said:
        <blockquote>
            Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other
            time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that
            we seek.
        </blockquote>

    <h1>Blocks and Inline Elements</h1>
    <div class = "division">
        A div is a block-level element, which means that it will always start up a new line 
        and take up the full width available.
    </div>
    <span>
        And a span tag is inline, 
    </span>
    <span>
